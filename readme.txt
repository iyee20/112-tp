Water Emblem
Water Emblem is a role-playing game in which players control
a team of characters to defeat enemies and complete the story through
winning enough battles. Characters are gained through exchanging
in-game currency for random “gacha pulls.” After the story is complete,
players enter Freeplay mode, in which they can battle indefinitely.
