Water Emblem
Water Emblem is a role-playing game in which players control
a team of characters ("units") to defeat enemies and complete the story through
winning enough battles. Characters are gained through exchanging
in-game currency for random “gacha pulls.” After the story is complete,
players enter Freeplay mode, in which they can battle indefinitely. 

How to Run the Game
Please open the file tp_event_functions.py and run it. All of the .py files must
be in one folder. Please put the folder "images" (contains all images), the
folder "saves" (contains all save files), and the folder "audio" (contains all
audio files) in this same folder.

Libraries
The following must be imported/installed in order to run the game:
+ random
+ os
+ pydub
+ simpleaudio

Shortcuts
In Settings, pressing "Toggle Cheats" will activate cheats.
When cheats are active:
+ pressing "C" in settings will give you all characters
+ pressing "L" in settings will level up all obtained characters by 10 levels
+ pressing "S" in settings will switch to the sample save (already on Freeplay)
+ pressing "F" in settings will toggle the game mode (story or freeplay)
+ pressing "H" in the transition screen will bring you back to the main screen
+ pressing "E" in the transition screen will bring you to the ending cutscene

Usage
All images and the background music were created by me. Please contact me if you
would like to reuse them. All other audio clips belong to the voice actors and
should not be reused by anyone else.

10 May 2021 Update
Thanks to the efforts of many people, Water Emblem has enjoyed a degree of
success. However, term project season is over and I want to move on to new
things, so this repository will be archived from now on.
To future CMU students: this project got a 93.7 as a final grade, but that
doesn't mean anything. I put 52 hours into it and enjoyed every minute!
